This plugin only works with CyberChimps Themes. Adds Google Analytics to your CyberChimps theme options

== Description ==

This plugin has been designed specifically for <a href="http://profiles.wordpress.org/cyberchimps/" title="CyberChimps' Themes">CyberChimps Themes</a>. It will not work on any other theme
at the moment. Wordpress is working with theme developers like <a href="http://cyberchimps.com" title="CyberChimps">CyberChimps.com</a> to make sure that the theme's functionality is limited to
design, layout and structure and that anything that falls outside of this is developed as a plugin. Hence the reason why this plugin has been developed.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `cyberchimpsextras` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why have the Webmaster options moved to a plugin? =

Wordpress is very keen (as we are) to separate functionality from design. Among other things it keeps themes from being bloated, it's cleaner code wise and allows users to choose what features they
 want.

= Will it work for any theme? =

No, currently this will only work with CyberChimps' themes.

= Where is the input for my Google Analytics code? =

Go to your theme options and the header section and it is in there. Copy and paste your code and click on save and your Google Analytics will be running. For any previous users of our free themes
if you already had code there then after activating this plugin your code should still be there.
